# GitHub user guide
###
My deliverable is a GitHub user guide including an explanation of what is GitHub, as well as the first basic steps to get started.

<b>My target audience are beginning GitHub users who may have little or no experience with the software. I have used myself as the persona for this project. The user stories in this guide are based on my own user experiences as a beginner in GitHub. </b> 

The focus of this guide is on GitHub as a technical writing tool. Therefore, in the future, the project will be enriched with an emphasis on the Wiki function.

The purpose of this guide is to introduce GitHub to beginning users and to help them perform the first basic operations with it.
